Democratic peace research program

Democracies are more likely than other kinds of governments to:

- **ally** with one another;
- **trade** with one another;
- form **long-lasting intergovernmental organizations**;
- **accept mediation** in disputes with one another;
- obey **international law**;
- **avoid militarized disputes** with one another short of war;
- and **win the wars** in which they choose to participate.

Controlling for the effects of numerous variables:

- contiguity, wealth, alliance membership, relative military capabilities, rates of economic growth, and the presence of hegemon.
